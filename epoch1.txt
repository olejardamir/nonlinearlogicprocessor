Experimental next-generation CMOS replacement foundation

To keep it very brief and simple:

d²u/dt² — v² * d²u/dx² + γ * du/dt + μ * u³ =
η * [L(α1 * u1) + L(α2 * u2) — L(α1 * u1) * L(α2 * u2)]
+ λ * u(x, t — τ)

with

L(F) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * tanh(((F / (m * a0 + ε)) — θ) / β)))

Using the OR gate as a base, we can build:

NOT: 1 - L(F)
AND: L(u1) * L(u2)
XOR: L(u1) + L(u2) - 2 * L(u1) * L(u2)
We can also generalize it to N input gates, for example:
OR_N = 1 — ∏_{i=1}^N (1 — L(α_i * u_i))

Peak speeds of ~1 THz
Sustained speeds in the 10–100 GHz range due to noise
Going beyond: ultrashort pulses, cryogenic cooling, and parallelism, potentially exploring quantum-classical hybrids or optomechanical coupling.
The heat issue exists only with Memristors, Phase-change, 2D materials, and maybe Organic neuromorphics. Solving the heat isse for components can imply a low-heat system that can achieve great computational powers at a room temperature.
