In this epoch, the primary innovation is a shift toward general-purpose, energy-efficient computing platforms suitable for home-scale systems. This is achieved by adopting photon-free, thermally efficient materials capable of both logic processing and memory storage within a unified physical framework, fully eliminating dependence on CMOS technology.

Governing Dynamics (Logic + Memory)
  d²u/dt² − v²·d²u/dx² + γ·du/dt + μ·u³ = η·N(u₁, ..., u_N) + λ·u(x, t − τ) + ξ(x, t)

The nonlinear PDE governs the spatiotemporal evolution of signals within the material.

Time-delayed feedback (λ·u(x, t − τ)) replaces the global clock, implementing asynchronous sequencing.

ξ(x, t) provides external programmatic control via voltage or magnetic pulses.

Activation and Thresholding (Physical, Bistable)
  L(F) = bistable_snap(F)
   → Implemented using ferroelectric polarization switching, not sigmoid approximations.

Unlike analog soft logic, bistability provides reliable digital outputs (0 or 1).

No comparators are needed; thresholding is intrinsic to the material state.

Logic Realization via Physical States
Nonlinear term enables native logic computation:

  N(u₁, ..., u_N) ≈
   Σᵢ αᵢ·L(uᵢ) − Σ_{i<j} β_{ij}·L(uᵢ)·L(uⱼ)

Logic Gates (using bistable L(F)):

NOT:    1 − L(u₁)

AND:    L(u₁) · L(u₂)

XOR:    L(u₁) + L(u₂) − 2·L(u₁)·L(u₂)

OR (N-input): 1 − ∏₁ⁿ(1 − L(αᵢ·uᵢ))

All gates retain internal state unless externally reset—combining logic and memory physically.

Elimination of Global Clock (Time-as-Logic)
λ·u(x, t − τ) enables asynchronous logic chaining via delay dynamics, not edge-triggered clocks.

Pulsed local domains act as event-driven logic zones, reducing power and complexity.
