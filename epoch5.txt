Main Dynamic Equation (First-Order, Stable, Directional, Passive-Core with Minimal Active Support, Noise-Robust):

    tau * du/dt - v * du/dx + gamma * (u - u^3) + kappa * tanh(u - u_hat) + beta * tanh(u_hat - u_hat_delayed) = eta * S(u1, u2) + xi(x, t)

Where:
    u(x, t) is the normalized logic state field in [-1, 1], representing bistable digital states.
    u_hat(x, t) is a smoothed memory trace of u.
    u_hat_delayed(x, t) is a time-lagged version of u_hat.
    (u - u^3) creates passive double-well convergence.
    tanh(u - u_hat) provides memory-trace alignment with soft dynamics.
    tanh(u_hat - u_hat_delayed) introduces directional drift with bounded energy.
    Each term is compatible with passive dynamics, with optional low-power active biasing where needed.

Bounded Memory Trace and Lag Filter:

    tau1 * du_hat/dt = -u_hat + tanh(u / epsilon)
    tau2 * du_hat_delayed/dt = -u_hat_delayed + u_hat

Where:
    u_hat softly follows u, limited by saturation.
    u_hat_delayed implements a basic time delay.
    tau1, tau2, and epsilon are material-dependent and tunable.

Soft Logic Source Term:

    S(u1, u2) = Q(L(u1), L(u2))
    L(F) = 0.5 * (1 + F / sqrt(F^2 + delta^2))
    Q(A, B) = exp(-(A - B)^2 / delta^2)

Where:
    L(F) maps inputs to [0, 1] range smoothly.
    Q(A, B) behaves like XNOR for soft inputs, tunable via delta.

Logic Gates:

    NOT:    1 - L(F)
    AND:    L(u1) * L(u2)
    XNOR:   Q(L(u1), L(u2))
    OR_n:   1 - Product[i=1 to n] (1 - L(alpha_i * u_i))
    MAJ_n:  L((1/n) * Sum[i=1 to n] L(alpha_i * u_i) - 0.5)

Note:
    All logic assumes asynchronous updates with gating to prevent instability.
    Feedback dampening or update masking may be required to avoid race conditions.

Reprogramming and Initialization Field:

    xi(x, t) = Theta(u) * G(u) * P_local(u) + R(x) * (1 - u^2)

Where:
    Theta(u) = 1 / (1 + (du/dt)^2 / epsilon^2) suppresses updates away from equilibrium.
    G(u) = 1 - u^2 restricts updates near attractors.
    P_local(u) is a gated update signal activated by local energy thresholds.
    R(x) seeds initial patterns.

Material Platform (Passive-Core, Active-Assist):

Ferroelectric Logic Plane:
    Material: HfZrOx
    Function: Polarization-based bistable state retention.

Memristive Interconnect Plane:
    Material: Doped HfOx
    Function: Programmable resistance and coupling.

Temporal Memory Plane:
    Material: Relaxor ferroelectric or magnetoelectric oxide
    Function: Time smoothing, optional active refresh.

Note:
    Auxiliary active biasing may be used for sensing, thresholding, or refresh.

Layered Architecture:

    - Vertically stacked oxide/polymer layers
    - Thermal isolation with low-k spacing
    - Defined overlap zones for interaction
    - Crosstalk reduced via shielding

Fabrication Strategy:

    - Additive patterning with relaxed resolution
    - Functional overlap defines behavior
    - Minimal doping accuracy required
    - Compatible with BEOL processing
    - Error tolerance via field attractor dynamics

Performance Targets:

    Switching Speed:     10-50 MHz (asynchronous)
    Static Power:        Near zero
    Dynamic Power:       < 1 pJ/event
    Energy per Switch:   < 10 pJ
    Signal Lifetime tau: 100-500 ns (adjustable)
    Reprogram Window:    > tau2 for stability

Programming and Adaptation:

    - u stored in ferroelectric domains
    - u_hat, u_hat_delayed from relaxation dynamics
    - P_local driven by local field thresholds
    - Updates managed via:
        * Local interactions
        * Gated convergence
        * Passive noise rejection

Compiled PDE Logic Network:

    - Nodes: Logic states in distributed substrate
    - Links: Interconnects with delay control
    - Dynamics: Locally updated, convergent
    - Inputs: Analog converted to bistable
    - Directionality: From asymmetric delays
    - Robustness: Resistant to noise/variations
    - Readout: Non-destructive via sensing

Final Remarks:

    This system uses passive-dominant dynamics with minimal active control. Logic arises from field-driven convergence instead of clocked sequences. Memory and directionality are based on asymmetric delay and stable attractors.

    Practical systems will likely need hybrid integration for sensing, refresh, and thresholding. The architecture supports scaling through modularity and tolerance to material variation.
