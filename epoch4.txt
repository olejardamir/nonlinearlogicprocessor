In this epoch, the primary innovation is a shift toward general-purpose, energy-efficient computing platforms suitable for home-scale systems. This is achieved by adopting non-photonic, thermally efficient materials capable of both logic processing and memory functions within a unified physical framework.

To keep it very brief and simple:

  d²u/dt² − v²·d²u/dx² + γ·du/dt + μ·u³ = η·N(u₁, u₂, ..., u_N) + λ·u(x, t − τ) + ξ(x, t)

Where the sigmoidal activation function is:

  L(F) = 1 / (1 + exp(−k·tanh((F / (m·a₀ + ε) − θ) / β)))

The nonlinear term N(u₁, ..., u_N) enables logic computation via:

  N(u₁, ..., u_N) ≈
   Σᵢ αᵢ·L(uᵢ) − Σ_{i<j} β_{ij}·L(uᵢ)·L(uⱼ)

This form balances expressive logic capacity with physical feasibility. Higher-order terms are excluded to enable real-world implementation using compact hardware components.

Logic Gate Realization (Thresholded Using L(F)):

NOT:    1 − L(F)

AND (2-input): L(u₁)·L(u₂)

XOR (2-input): L(u₁) + L(u₂) − 2·L(u₁)·L(u₂)

N-input OR:  1 − ∏₁ⁿ(1 − L(αᵢ·uᵢ))

Each gate can be implemented in hardware using combinations of memristive weightings, spin-wave paths, or ferroelectric logic elements. Output thresholding is handled via comparators or bistable circuits to enforce digital signal levels.

The delay term λ·u(x, t − τ) introduces memory and sequencing through time-delayed feedback—similar to delay lines or oscillator loops. The external input ξ(x, t) supports programmability by reconfiguring weights, polarities, or state transitions depending on the platform.
