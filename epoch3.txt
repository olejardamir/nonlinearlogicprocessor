Epoch Shift: Toward Low-Heat, High-Performance General-Purpose Computing

In this epoch, the main change is to make the system applicable to general-purpose, energy-efficient computing suitable for home-scale machines, by adopting non-photonic, thermally efficient platforms.

To keep it very brief and simple:

  d²u/dt² − v² * d²u/dx² + γ * du/dt + μ * u³ = η * N(u₁, u₂, …, u_N) + λ * u(x, t − τ) + ξ(x, t)

Where the sigmoidal activation function is defined as:

  L(F) = 1 / (1 + exp(−k * tanh(((F / (m * a₀ + ε)) − θ) / β)))

The nonlinear function N(u₁, ..., u_N) generalizes logic operations:

  N(u₁, ..., u_N) =
   Σᵢ αᵢ * L(uᵢ)
   − Σ_{i<j} β_{ij} * L(uᵢ) * L(uⱼ)
   + Σ_{i<j<k} γ_{ijk} * L(uᵢ) * L(uⱼ) * L(u_k)
   − … (higher order terms)

Logic gates are constructed as:

NOT:    1 − L(F)

AND (2 inputs): L(u₁) * L(u₂)

XOR (2 inputs): L(u₁) + L(u₂) − 2 * L(u₁) * L(u₂)

N-input OR:  1 − ∏₁ⁿ (1 − L(αᵢ * uᵢ))

The delay term λ * u(x, t − τ) enables memory and sequential logic via time-delayed feedback. The input term ξ(x, t) allows for external programmability and control.

Performance and Practical Considerations

Theoretical peak switching speeds: up to 1 THz (spintronics, ferroelectrics)

Sustained operation: 10–100 GHz under typical conditions

All platforms operate at or near room temperature

No optical components required (unlike photonic logic)

Integrable into conventional IC packaging

Thermal Management

This hybrid configuration minimizes heat generation:

Spintronics: Low heat due to spin-wave computation (no net charge transport)

Memristors: No static power; minimal heat during switching

Ferroelectrics: Fast, low-energy state changes with low thermal footprint

Efficient thermal properties make this architecture highly suitable for home-scale computing systems, outperforming CMOS in energy efficiency, speed, and scalability without the need for photonic or cryogenic systems.
