Dynamic Equation:

The foundational dynamic equation combines stability, low power, noise robustness, memory, and logic capabilities:

τ·du/dt - v·du/dx + γ·(u - u³) + κ·tanh(u - û) + β·tanh(û - û_delayed) + λ·u(x, t - τ_delay) = η·N(u₁, u₂, ..., u_N) + ξ(x, t)

where:

u(x, t) is the normalized logic state field, bistably digital [-1, 1].

û is a smoothly tracked memory trace of u.

û_delayed implements a basic time-delay for sequential logic.

λ·u(x, t - τ_delay) explicitly adds controllable delayed feedback for stable memory and sequencing.

ξ(x, t) offers external programmability for initialization and reconfiguration.

Activation and Logic:

The sigmoidal activation function ensuring stable, noise-resistant transitions:

L(F) = 1 / [1 + exp(-k·tanh(((F/(m·a₀+ε)) - θ)/β))]

Logic gates constructed robustly from L(F):

NOT: 1 - L(F)

AND: L(u₁)·L(u₂)

XOR: L(u₁) + L(u₂) - 2·L(u₁)·L(u₂)

N-input OR: 1 - ∏₁ⁿ (1 - L(αᵢ·uᵢ))

Materials and Platforms:

Hybrid, photon-free, low-thermal footprint materials ensuring room-temperature operation:

Ferroelectric Logic Plane: HfZrOx for bistable retention and low leakage.

Memristive Interconnect Plane: Doped HfOx for programmable coupling and nonvolatile memory.

Spintronics Layer: Fe, Co, Ni-based spin-wave logic paths for ultrafast, low-thermal wave-based propagation.

Optional temporal memory enhancement via relaxor ferroelectric materials for time smoothing.

Thermal Efficiency and Power:

Virtually zero static power due to ferroelectric bistability and memristive passive interconnects.

Minimal dynamic power (< 1 pJ/event), reducing energy per switch below 10 pJ.

Spintronics ensures near-zero Joule heating due to spin-wave (no net charge transport).

Performance Targets:

Switching Speed: up to 100 GHz operationally; potential peak of 1 THz via spintronic layer.

Signal Lifetime (τ): tunable from 100-500 ns for optimized sequential logic and memory.

Compact, stackable architecture with thermal isolation and crosstalk minimization through low-k materials and defined overlap zones.

Fabrication and Integration:

Additive, relaxed-resolution BEOL-compatible processing.

Low doping precision required, tolerant to material variability.

Scalable, modular, easily integrable into conventional IC packaging.

Programmability and Adaptation:

FPGA-like adaptability through memristor-controlled weightings.

Spintronics and ferroelectric layers reconfigurable via voltage or current pulses.

Hybrid integration enables dynamic configuration and adaptive logic updates, essential for versatile general-purpose computing.

Robustness and Practicality:

Resilient to noise, manufacturing variations, and environmental factors through field-driven attractor dynamics.

Passive-dominant core dynamics ensure reliability and low maintenance.
