In this epoch, the main change is to make it applicable to general usage

To keep it very brief and simple:

d²u/dt² — v² * d²u/dx² + γ * du/dt + μ * u³ = η * N(u₁, u₂, …, u_N) + λ * u(x, t — τ) + ξ(x, t)

where

L(F) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * tanh(((F / (m * a₀ + ε)) — θ) / β)))

and the nonlinear function N generalizes logic operations:

N(u₁, …, u_N) =
Σᵢ αᵢ * L(uᵢ)
— Σ_{i<j} β_{ij} * L(uᵢ) * L(uⱼ)
+ Σ_{i<j<k} γ_{ijk} * L(uᵢ) * L(uⱼ) * L(u_k)
— … (higher order terms)

Using the OR gate as a base, logic gates can be constructed as:

NOT: 1 — L(F)
AND (2 inputs): L(u₁) * L(u₂)
XOR (2 inputs): L(u₁) + L(u₂) — 2 * L(u₁) * L(u₂)
N-input OR: 1 — product over i=1 to N of (1 — L(αᵢ * uᵢ))

The delay term λ * u(x, t — τ) enables memory and sequential logic by introducing time-delayed feedback. The input term ξ(x, t) allows external programmability and control.

Performance and practical considerations:

Peak switching speeds around 1 THz are theoretically possible in some platforms such as photonic logic and spintronics.
Sustained operational speeds typically range from 10 to 100 GHz due to noise, thermal effects, and material limits.
Pushing beyond these limits involves ultrashort optical pulses, cryogenic cooling, and massive parallelism.
Emerging hybrid approaches, including quantum-classical hybrids and optomechanical coupling, are being explored.

Thermal management:

Heat dissipation is a significant challenge, especially for memristors, phase-change materials, 2D materials, and organic neuromorphic devices.
Efficient heat management can enable low-heat, room-temperature operation with high computational density without thermal degradation.
Spintronics, ferroelectrics, and photonic logic typically produce lower heat, making them promising for energy-efficient systems.
